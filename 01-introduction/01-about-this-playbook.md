# About This Playbook

## Purpose of This Playbook

The BitDevs Playbook by Btrust is a comprehensive guide for organizers, sponsors, and partners involved in growing Bitcoin-only technical communities across Africa. It provides a clear framework for how to start, operate, and sustain BitDevs locations, while outlining the principles, expectations, and standards that ensure every location runs with the same quality, transparency, and impact.

This playbook serves as:
- A manual for organizers setting up or managing BitDevs locations.
- A reference for sponsors and partners to understand processes, reporting, and accountability standards.
- A resource for community members who want to align with the broader BitDevs movement.

As BitDevs locations grow, improve, and share new lessons, this playbook will evolve to reflect these insights and strengthen the ecosystem. 

## How to Use This Playbook

This playbook is divided into clear sections that mirror the complete lifecycle of a BitDevs location, from setup, to operations, quality control, and eventual closure (if necessary). 

While everyone involved should read the entire playbook to understand how BitDevs locations operate as a cohesive network, the sections below provide a streamlined way to get started based on your role:
- New organizers: Begin with Section 2 (“Starting a BitDevs Location”) to learn how to set up a new location from scratch. Follow with Section 4 (“Quality Control”) to understand the standards expected from day one. Then, read Section 6 (“Guide for Organizers”) to learn best practices for leadership, teamwork, and personal growth.
- Active locations: Focus first on Section 3 (“Running a BitDevs Location”) for ongoing operations, planning, and reporting. Revisit Section 4 (“Quality Control”) regularly to stay aligned with community and operational standards. Refer to Section 6 (“Guide for Organizers”) to continue strengthening your organizing team and personal development. 
- Sponsors and supporters: Refer to Section 7 (“Guide for Sponsors”) for insights into how sponsorship works, reporting expectations, and how to collaborate effectively with location organizers. 
- Everyone: Refer to Section 1 (“Introduction”) as your foundation. It defines the principles and identity that all BitDevs locations must uphold. 

Each section includes clear steps, templates, and references. Annexes at the end contain standard forms, reporting templates, and examples for easy access.
