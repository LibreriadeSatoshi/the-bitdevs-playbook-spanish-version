# About This Playbook

## Purpose of This Playbook

> **Note**: As BitDevs locations grow, improve, and share new lessons, this playbook will evolve to reflect these insights and strengthen the ecosystem. 

The BitDevs Playbook by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/) is a comprehensive guide for organizers, sponsors, and partners involved in growing Bitcoin-only technical communities across Africa. It provides a clear framework for how to start, operate, and sustain BitDevs locations, while outlining the principles, expectations, and standards that ensure every location runs with the same quality, transparency, and impact.

This playbook serves as:
- A manual for organizers setting up or managing BitDevs locations.
- A reference for sponsors and partners to understand processes, reporting, and accountability standards.
- A resource for community members who want to align with the broader BitDevs movement.

## How to Use This Playbook

This playbook is divided into clear sections that mirror the complete lifecycle of a BitDevs location, from setup, to operations, quality control, and eventual closure (if necessary). While everyone involved should read the entire playbook to understand how BitDevs locations operate as a cohesive network, the sections below provide a streamlined way to get started based on your role:

- **New Organizers:** Start with Section 2: [“Starting a BitDevs Location”](02-starting-a-bitdevs-location/01-setting-up-a-location.md) to learn how to set up a new location from scratch. Follow with Section 4: [“Quality Control”](04-quality-control/01-core-standards.md) for standards from day one. Then, read Section 6: [“Guide for Organizers”](06-guide-for-organizers/01-roles-and-responsibilities.md) for team and personal development guidance.
- **Active Locations:** Focus first on Section 3: [“Running a BitDevs Location”](03-running-a-bitdevs-location/01-meetup-planning-and-coordination.md) for operational guidance. Revisit Section 4: [“Quality Control”](04-quality-control/01-core-standards.md) regularly. Refer to Section 6: [“Guide for Organizers”](06-guide-for-organizers/01-roles-and-responsibilities.md) to continue developing your team and skills.
- **Sponsors and Supporters:** Refer to Section 7 (“Guide for Sponsors”) for funding models, accountability, and collaboration expectations.   
- **Everyone:** Begin with Section 1: [“Introduction”](01-introduction/01-about-this-playbook.md) for foundational BitDevs principles, identity, and ethos.
