# Identity and Core Principles 

While each BitDevs community reflects its local culture and context, all locations share the same foundation: a set of principles that define what it means to be BitDevs.

1. **Bitcoin-Only**  
   BitDevs exists to explore Bitcoin, and only Bitcoin. All discussions, presentations, and projects must be directly related to Bitcoin’s technology, research, or development. This focus keeps conversations meaningful, technical, and free from distractions like unrelated projects or speculative narratives.

2. **Technical Focus**  
   BitDevs meetups are designed for people who want to understand how Bitcoin actually works. Topics typically cover protocol development, research, open-source projects, and developments in Bitcoin-adjacent technologies like Lightning or Miniscript. Anyone may attend, but the emphasis remains on advancing collective technical understanding.

3. **Socratic Format**  
   BitDevs uses a [Socratic Seminar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Socratic_seminar) discussion format, which is a guided, participatory conversation rather than a lecture. Moderators curate a list of relevant topics or recent updates, and attendees explore them together through questions and open discussion.

4. **Privacy-Respecting**  
   Privacy is a core part of BitDevs culture. By default, there’s no photography or recording unless everyone agrees. [Chatham House Rules apply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): what’s shared can be discussed publicly, but not who said it. This creates a safe space for open, honest conversation.

5. **Non-Commercial**  
   BitDevs is a neutral and non-commercial space. Meetups must be free to attend, and no one should use them to promote products or services. Sponsorships, where needed, cover only essential logistics like venue or refreshments.
