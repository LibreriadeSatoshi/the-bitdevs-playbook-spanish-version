# Records and Documentation

Each BitDevs location is assigned a shared folder named after their city (e.g., BitDevs Nairobi) for storing reports, budgets, and financial records. This folder is managed by the organizing team and must be kept up to date and well organized, as it is reviewed monthly by Btrust.

## Folder Structure

Every location’s main folder must include the following two core subfolders:

### 1. Meetup Reports

This folder contains documentation and summaries for each monthly meetup. Each entry should include:

- A completed event report using the standard template *(see Annex C: Event Report Format)*  
- Key takeaways from the session  
- Photos, if available and shared with consent  
- Agenda, speaker list, and attendance highlights  
- A link to the receipt folder and any relevant supporting documents  
- Notes on challenges faced or lessons learned  
- Follow-up actions and plans for the next meetup  

**Naming convention:**  
`YYYY-MM_BitDevs XXX_Meetup_Report`  
*(e.g., 2025-04_BitDevs Nairobi_Meetup_Report)*

### 2. Finance

This folder is used to track all financial activity related to meetup operations. Each entry must include:

- A completed finance report using the standard template *(see Annex D: Finance Report Format)*  
- Receipts and scanned invoices for every expense  
  - These should be uploaded in a separate folder and linked in the report  
- The BTC address used for disbursement or reimbursement  
- Any special notes, approvals, or context for reimbursements or one-off costs  

**Naming convention:**  
`YYYY-MM_BitDevs XXX_Finance_Report`  
*(e.g., 2025-04_BitDevs Nairobi_Finance_Report)*

## Submission Timeline

All meetup and finance documentation must be uploaded by the **10th of each month**, covering the previous month’s meetup.

### Archiving and Access Protocol

Each organizing team is responsible for keeping its folder updated and accurate.

- Access is restricted to location organizers and authorized Btrust staff  
- Files should **never be deleted**  
- Older files must be moved into a subfolder named:`Archive_Year`  

## Compliance

Consistent and accurate documentation is required to maintain sponsorship status. Locations that fail to update their records regularly may experience delays in funding or suspension of support.
