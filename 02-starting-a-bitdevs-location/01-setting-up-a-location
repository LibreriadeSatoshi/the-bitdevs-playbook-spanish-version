# Setting Up a Location

Launching a BitDevs location begins with understanding why it exists: to create a neutral, Bitcoin-only space where developers and builders can learn, debate, and collaborate on Bitcoin’s technical progress. 

Before you begin, confirm that your city has a genuine, active, or emerging developer interest in Bitcoin. This can be assessed through informal polls, community events, developer meetups, or conversations with local technical groups.

Once local interest is confirmed, take the following foundational steps:

## 1. Confirm Local Demand

Gather evidence of developer interest in Bitcoin-focused learning. This ensures that the community you are building has a clear audience and a meaningful purpose.

## 2. Form a Core Team

Assemble at least two or three committed organizers with a strong Bitcoin technical background (for example, alumni of [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) pathways) who can plan, communicate, and run monthly meetups effectively. If you are just starting out and do not yet know others with technical experience, do not let this stop you. Start with what you have and seek support from the broader BitDevs community. Shared ownership is essential for consistency and long-term continuity.

## 3. Define Your Location Identity

Choose your city name (e.g., *BitDevs Nairobi*), align on your shared goals, and draft a short paragraph that summarizes your purpose and local focus.

## 4. Establish Operational Tools

Set up basic systems required for coordination and record-keeping, including:

- An official email address  
- A shared folder for documentation  
- A communication platform such as WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal  

## 5. Plan the First Quarter

Outline a three-month plan that includes expected discussion topics, tentative meetup dates, and your outreach approach. This plan helps guide your launch and demonstrates commitment to potential sponsors, partners, and the wider BitDevs network.
