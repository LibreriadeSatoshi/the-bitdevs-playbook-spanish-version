# Finding and Working with Sponsors

Running a sustainable BitDevs location often requires financial or logistical support. Sponsors can help cover essential costs such as venue, refreshments, and materials, allowing organizers to focus on high-quality content and community building.

## Types of Support You Can Seek

BitDevs locations may receive support through a variety of channels, including:

- **Corporate Sponsorship**  
  Support from Bitcoin companies, exchanges, or developer-focused startups.

- **Community Grants**  
  Funding from nonprofits or open-source organizations that support education and technical growth.

- **In-kind Support**  
  Non-monetary contributions such as venue space, media coverage, refreshments, or volunteer time.

- **Individual Contributions**  
  Support from local Bitcoiners or community patrons who value technical education and open collaboration.

## How to Find a Sponsor

When seeking sponsorship, organizers should take the following steps:

1. Identify organizations that align with Bitcoin-only values and support open-source development.
2. Prepare a short proposal describing your location’s mission, structure, and projected expenses.
3. Include evidence of community demand, such as an active community group, past events, or interest sign-ups.
4. Outline the requested sponsorship amount and clearly explain how funds will be used and how accountability will be maintained.
5. Offer appropriate visibility in return, such as logo placement, sponsor acknowledgements, or brief introductions during BitDevs events.

## Sponsor Guidelines

To protect the integrity and independence of BitDevs, all sponsorships must follow these guidelines:

- Remain Bitcoin-only and independent; avoid sponsors that require brand control or agenda influence.
- Maintain transparent expense tracking and proper documentation.
- Report outcomes after each meetup, even when the sponsor does not explicitly require reporting.
- Diversify funding sources where possible to avoid overreliance on a single entity.
