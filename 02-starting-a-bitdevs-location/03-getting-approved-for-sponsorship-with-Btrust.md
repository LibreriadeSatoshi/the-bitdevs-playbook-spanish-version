# Getting Approved for Sponsorship (with Btrust)

Btrust sponsorship enables BitDevs locations to operate smoothly and sustainably. It covers eligible expenses such as venue, refreshments, and basic logistics, and includes structured support for operations, quality control, and reporting.

## Sponsorship Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for Btrust sponsorship, a BitDevs location must:

- Commit to being Bitcoin-only and hosting technical, Bitcoin-focused discussions.
- Have at least two active organizers to ensure accountability and continuity. Ideally include organizers with technical experience and community involvement (e.g., alumni from [Btrust Builders](https://www.btrust.tech/builders) pathways, [Chaincode Labs](https://chaincode.com/), or [Bitshala](https://bitshala.org/)). In regions with few Bitcoin developers, a single committed organizer may start a location. In such cases, the organizer should actively work toward adding another organizer within a defined timeframe (e.g., six months) to support sustainability and growth.
- Agree to run monthly meetups and maintain proper documentation.
- Follow BitDevs core principles of neutrality, privacy, and openness.
- Submit monthly Meetup Reports and Finance Reports using the standard templates.
- Participate in monthly organizer check-ins for continued learning and accountability.

*(See [Annex F: Monthly Organizer Check-in Template.](08-annexes.md))*

## Application Process

The Btrust sponsorship application process includes the following steps:

1. **Application Submission**  
   Complete the [application form](https://btrust.homerun.co/bitdevs-application-sponsorship/en) with organizer details and a short proposal describing your local context, goals, and expected activities.

2. **Review and Approval**  
   Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis, typically within two to three weeks.

3. **Introductory Call**  
   Approved applicants will have a short introductory call with the Btrust team to:
   - Review plans and proposed activities
   - Clarify expectations and reporting requirements
   - Confirm readiness to host a meetup

4. **Trial Period (Three Months)**  
   Approved locations are onboarded into the BitDevs network, added to shared communication channels, and granted access to operational tools and sponsorship.  
   All locations begin with a three-month trial sponsorship starting from their first event. During this period, locations must:
   - Submit monthly Meetup and Finance Reports
   - Participate in the monthly organizer check-in meeting
   - Follow the Socratic format and maintain neutrality

## What Btrust Provides

Btrust sponsorship includes:

- Funding allocation for monthly meetups
- Standard templates for meetup planning, finance, and reporting
- Operational guidance and access to the global BitDevs organizer network
- Ongoing feedback, learning sessions, and visibility for active locations

## Continuation of Sponsorship

Sponsorship is ongoing but depends on maintaining active location status, reasonable attendance, timely reporting, and continued alignment with this playbook.

This model may also serve as a reference for other locations seeking structured partnerships or designing their own sponsorship frameworks.
