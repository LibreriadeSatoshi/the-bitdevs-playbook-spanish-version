# Building Your Organizing Team

A strong organizing team is the backbone of every BitDevs location. While team size and structure may vary by city, each location should aim to balance technical competence with organizational reliability to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Core Organizing Roles

At a minimum, every BitDevs location should define and assign the following roles. One person may hold more than one role in smaller teams, especially during early stages.

| Role | Key Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------------|
| **Lead Organizer** | Coordinates overall planning, oversees communication with sponsors or partners, and ensures compliance with reporting and operational standards. |
| **Technical Moderator** | Curates topics and readings for each meetup, moderates Socratic discussions, and maintains the technical depth and quality of conversations. |
| **Finance & Logistics Lead** | Manages budgeting, expense tracking, and the submission of funding requests or reimbursements. |

Depending on capacity, locations may also include optional roles such as:

- **Communications or Outreach Lead** – Promotes meetups within the local developer ecosystem and manages community announcements or social channels.

## Team Guidelines

Organizing teams are expected to follow these best practices:

- Meet regularly to plan upcoming sessions and review reports.
- Use shared folders and standard templates to support documentation, transparency, and continuity.
- Rotate tasks where possible to prevent burnout and build capacity across the team.
- Stay aligned with regional updates, shared learnings, and best practices from other BitDevs locations.
