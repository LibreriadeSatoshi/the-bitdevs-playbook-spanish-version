# Planning and Hosting Your First Meetup

Your first meetup introduces your community to what BitDevs is. The goal is to keep it simple, structured, and participatory.

## Steps to Prepare

### 1. Choose a Venue
- Select a consistent, neutral, and accessible venue, such as a local tech hub or co-working space.
- Ensure basic facilities: projector, reliable power, seating, restrooms, drinking water, ventilation, and safety.

### 2. Promote Responsibly
- Announce your meetup on relevant channels (website (example: https://bitdevs[acronym].org/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/), X/Twitter), emphasizing the technical, Bitcoin-only nature.
- Invite people to register to attend. Also see more actions under [Media and Communications](#media-and-communications).
- For Btrust-sponsored locations, share  the confirmed meetup details in the **BitDevs Organizers in Africa Discord** channel for cross-promotion by Btrust through our official pages. 
- Include social card, date, time, and agenda/topics for visibility.

### 3. Plan the Budget
- Prepare a simple cost breakdown for venue, refreshments, and logistics.  
- Use estimated attendance numbers to guide your planning.
- Submit budget proposals early if applying for sponsorship.  
- Btrust-sponsored locations submit through the standard monthly expense process before the event.

*(See: [Annex G: Budget Request Template](08-annexes.md))*  
*(See: [Annex H: Expense Protocol](08-annexes.md))*

### 4. Curate Topics
- Select relevant Bitcoin developments or research topics.
- Draw inspiration from global BitDevs locations or official mailing lists.
- Avoid beginner-level talks that can drift into non-Bitcoin content.
- Focus on meaningful learning and discussion.

### 5. Run the Meetup
- Begin with an introduction to BitDevs and its principles.
- Follow the [Socratic seminar format](https://bitdevs.org/running-a-great-socratic-seminar/): short summaries, open questions, collective exploration.
- Apply [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) to encourage honest dialogue and protect privacy.
- Keep time strictly. Discussions should flow but remain within the planned duration.

### 6. Engage Participants
- Encourage first-time attendees to ask questions.
- End with informal networking and light refreshments to strengthen community bonds.
- Invite participants to join community channels for updates on future meetups.

### 7. Document the Event
- Record attendance, discussion highlights, and lessons learned.
- Btrust-sponsored locations complete the **Meetup Report** and **Finance Report** using the standard templates.
- Upload documentation by the **10th of the following month** to your location folder.

### 8. Reflect and Iterate
- Choose topics suitable for your audience’s level to maximize engagement.
- Review feedback after each meetup and plan improvements for the next session.
- Support participants in their ongoing learning journey. Act as an accountability partner, even if they don’t make it to the next session.

## Media and Communications

A strong online presence helps promote meetups, share resources, and keep the community engaged. Each BitDevs location is encouraged to set up the following:

### Website
- Create a website following the standard format: `https://bitdevs[acronym].org/`
- Example reference: [BitDevs Nairobi](https://www.bitdevsnbo.org/) website  
- Setup instructions and theme guide are [available separately](https://github.com/BitDevsNBO/bitdevsnbo.org/blob/master/README.md).

### Social Media
- Set up a dedicated **Nostr** or **X (formerly Twitter)** page to share updates and resources.

### Social Card
- Prepare a monthly social card with BitDevs name, date, time, and venue.
- For Btrust-sponsored locations, add the footnote **“Sponsored by Btrust”**. See [this flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ejzNXIYDNag4B_4-1nIK6MUw_a8MFeH/view?usp=drive_link) for reference. 

### Event Registration

### After Your First Meetup

Once your first event is completed and reported:

- Publish a short recap on your BitDevs website to maintain visibility.
- Begin planning the next meetup immediately to sustain momentum.
- Continue monthly sessions using attendee feedback and insights.
- Strengthen ties with sponsors through regular updates and visible impact.
- Track documentation, finances, and progress.
- Build relationships with other BitDevs locations to exchange ideas and resources.

By completing these steps, your location transitions from **setup** to **active status**, ready to operate under the guidelines in **Section 3: [Running a BitDevs Location](03-running-a-bitdevs-location.md)**.
