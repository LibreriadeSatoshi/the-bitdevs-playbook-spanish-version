# Meetup Planning and Coordination

Once a BitDevs location is established, the focus moves from setup to sustainability. Running a location means keeping discussions consistent, participation active, and community values strong. This section provides practical guidance on planning effective meetups, choosing relevant topics, fostering meaningful engagement, and maintaining operational standards.

## Scheduling

- Host meetups at a fixed frequency (ideally monthly) on a consistent day of the week or month, such as the last Thursday of each month.
- Publish your event calendar in advance on your website and social media to help attendees plan ahead.
- Avoid long gaps between meetups; consistency builds trust and encourages retention.

## Venue and Logistics

- Choose a neutral, accessible venue such as a tech hub, university innovation space, or co-working center.
- Ensure the space has reliable power, Wi-Fi, a projector or screen, and seating adequate for your expected audience.
- Keep the setup simple. Focus on a comfortable, discussion-friendly environment rather than elaborate decorations.

### Operational Coordination

- Assign clear responsibilities within your organizing team for venue booking, content preparation, communication, and reporting.
- Maintain a running checklist for each event covering key steps: topic confirmation, speaker communication, logistics, materials, refreshments, and follow-up tasks.
- For Btrust-sponsored locations:
  - Submit monthly expense requests by the 10th of the month.
  - Track all expenses and upload receipts after each meetup to your location folder.

### Time Management

- Start on time and aim to keep the total duration within 90 minutes to 2 hours.
- Allocate time for introductions, discussions, and networking.
- Use a timer to keep sessions on track and prevent any one topic from dominating the discussion.
