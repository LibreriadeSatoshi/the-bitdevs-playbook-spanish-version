# Growing and Engaging the Community

The strength of a BitDevs location lies in its people: engaged, curious participants who contribute ideas and discussions. Building this community requires intentional outreach and inclusion.

## Attracting Participants

- Share meetups on social media, Bitcoin forums, and local tech communities.
- Encourage attendees to bring colleagues or friends interested in Bitcoin development.
- Partner with developer hubs or blockchain clubs at universities to introduce new audiences.

## Retaining and Supporting Members

- Maintain consistent communication via your community platform (WhatsApp, Telegram, or Discord).
- Welcome newcomers warmly, provide a short introduction to what BitDevs is, and clarify that no prior expertise is required to participate.
- Collect post-event feedback and use it to improve structure and content.
- Recognize active contributors; those who consistently attend, volunteer, or present, to build a sense of belonging.

## Fostering an Inclusive Environment

- Keep the discussion open and merit-based, focusing on ideas rather than hierarchy.
- Encourage gender diversity and participation from underrepresented groups in tech.
- Offer mentorship or study group sessions for those eager to deepen their understanding.

## Sustaining Momentum

- Supplement monthly meetups with study circles, hack sessions, or workshops to maintain engagement.
- Collaborate with other local locations for cross-city discussions or shared sessions.
- For Btrust-sponsored locations: participate in the monthly organizers’ call to share lessons and stay aligned with network-wide activities.
