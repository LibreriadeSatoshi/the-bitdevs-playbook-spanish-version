# Core Standards

As BitDevs locations grow, maintaining quality becomes as important as hosting regular meetups. Quality control ensures that every BitDevs location, regardless of geography or sponsorship, upholds the same high standards that define the network: neutrality, technical depth, openness, and community trust.

This section outlines the shared benchmarks that sustain integrity and credibility across the global BitDevs ecosystem.

## Shared Network Standards

Every BitDevs location operates under a set of non-negotiable standards. These principles preserve the reputation, trust, and independence of the network.

1. **Bitcoin-Only Focus**  
   All meetups, discussions, and learning materials must remain strictly focused on Bitcoin and its related open-source technologies. Altcoins, tokens, and marketing-driven content are not permitted.

2. **Free and Open Access**  
   Meetups must be open to the public and free to attend. Registration systems may be used for planning purposes, but access must never be gated through paid tickets.

3. **Regular Activity**  
   Locations should aim to host at least one meetup per month to maintain consistency and engagement. Inactive periods longer than three months require communication and justification to the broader network.

4. **Technical Rigor**  
   Discussions should prioritize code, design, and implementation details over hype or speculation. While concepts may be simplified for new participants, technical accuracy must never be compromised. Organizers are encouraged to reference trusted resources such as [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org/) and [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/) for current and historical technical topics.

5. **Privacy and Neutrality**  
   [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) apply to all discussions. Attendees should not be identified without explicit consent. Organizers must remain neutral and avoid promoting specific companies, products, or ideological positions.

For Btrust-sponsored locations, adherence to these core standards is a condition for continued funding. Consistency, transparency, and evidence of active engagement, demonstrated through timely monthly reports, are used to assess ongoing sponsorship eligibility.
