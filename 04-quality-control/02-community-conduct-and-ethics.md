# Community Conduct and Ethics

A high-quality BitDevs community is defined not only by its technical content, but also by its culture. Each location must uphold a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment where all participants feel safe to learn, question, and contribute. 

## Community Principles

All BitDevs locations are expected to uphold the following principles: 

1. **Respect and Professionalism**  
   Treat every participant equally, regardless of background, experience, or opinions. Personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory remarks are not tolerated.

2. **Constructive Dialogue**  
   Encourage debate and critical thinking while keeping discussions fact-based, technical, and courteous.

3. **Inclusivity**  
   Proactively welcome participants from underrepresented groups in tech, including women and young developers, and foster an environment where diverse perspectives are valued.

4. **Non-Commercial Integrity**  
   Avoid marketing, sponsorship pitches, or financial incentives during meetups. All speakers and attendees participate as learners and contributors, not as customers or authorities.

5. **Transparency**  
   Communicate clearly about sponsorships, funding usage, and partnerships to maintain community trust and accountability.

## Code of Conduct Requirements (Btrust-Sponsored Locations)

For Btrust-sponsored locations:

- This Code of Conduct must be shared publicly (for example, on the location website or meetup registration page).
- All organizers and moderators must be familiar with and committed to enforcing these standards.
- Any reported violations should be documented and communicated during the next organizer check-in or through the Btrust support channel for guidance and resolution.
