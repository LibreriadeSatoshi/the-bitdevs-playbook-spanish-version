# Final Reports and Handover

Closing a location is an administrative process that requires completion of all outstanding reports, financial reconciliations, and file archiving. This step ensures that your location’s work remains part of the shared network record and supports any future relaunch.

## Essential Closure Tasks

- **Submit Final Meetup and Finance Reports**  
  Capture details from your last few events, even if they were small, informal, or partially attended. Accurate reporting preserves learning and accountability.

- **Expense Reconciliation**  
  Account for all sponsorship funds received and used. Clearly report or return any remaining balance according to the agreed sponsorship process.

- **Documentation Upload**  
  Ensure your location folder contains up-to-date materials, including meeting notes, reports, receipts, photos (if approved), and any operational templates used during active periods.

- **Public Communication**  
  Post a short notice or pinned message on your website or primary social channel indicating that the location is paused or closed. This helps external visitors understand the status and avoids confusion. 

- **Team Handover**  
  If another organizer or a new team plans to continue in the future, provide access to digital assets (email accounts, website admin access, shared folders, and social media) only where there is mutual agreement between the outgoing and incoming teams. This ensures trust, consent, and clarity around credibility and use of the location’s assets.

## For Btrust-Sponsored Locations

- The final finance report must include a summary of all expenses from the last active month and confirmation of any unused funds.
- All folders and access credentials (Google Drive, website admin panels, event platforms) should remain within the shared Btrust system for continuity.
- The Btrust team will acknowledge receipt of all reports and confirm that the location has officially completed the closeout process.

Proper handover maintains the location’s credibility and ensures that future teams can restart smoothly without rebuilding systems or records from scratch.
