# Reopening or Reapplying

Communities evolve, and many paused locations eventually return stronger, with new energy or leadership. The BitDevs network encourages such revivals when there is renewed local interest and a clear plan for sustainability. 

## Reopening Process (General)

If your location was previously paused or closed, reopening should follow the same intentional standards as starting fresh, while building on past experience.

- **Refer Back to Setup Guidance**  
  Review *Starting a BitDevs Location* to realign with the core purpose, principles, and operational expectations.

- **Assess Local Demand**  
  Confirm that a technical Bitcoin community still exists or can realistically be revived in your area through outreach, conversations, or pilot sessions.

- **Assemble a Core Team**  
  Identify at least two organizers committed to relaunching and sustaining meetups on a regular basis.

- **Review and Update Materials**  
  Use previous documentation, reports, and lessons learned as a foundation. Update goals, formats, or processes where needed.

- **Announce the Relaunch**  
  Communicate publicly about the location’s return through your website or social channels. Reference earlier activities to maintain continuity and credibility.

### Reapplication (for Btrust-Sponsored Locations)

Locations that were previously sponsored by Btrust may reapply for support.

- Reapply using the standard sponsorship [application form](https://btrust.homerun.co/bitdevs-application-sponsorship/en).
- Include a short summary of the location’s previous history and performance.
- Clearly explain what has changed (e.g., new organizers, improved structure, refined focus).
- Present a realistic plan for sustainable operations and community growth.

Btrust reviews reapplications based on readiness, prior engagement, lessons learned, and current community demand. Approved locations may receive a new three-month trial sponsorship before returning to full active status.

This process ensures that returning locations restart with improved structure, renewed capacity, and insights gained from earlier experience.
