# Guide for Organizers 

This section serves as a toolkit for BitDevs organizers. It provides clear guidance on roles, responsibilities, and best practices to help lead effectively and build strong, collaborative teams. It is designed to help both new and active locations improve operations, strengthen leadership, and foster personal growth as community builders. 

# Roles and Responsibilities

This section defines what it means to be a BitDevs organizer and outlines the roles and responsibilities required to run a high-quality, sustainable location.

## Who Should Be an Organizer? 

A BitDevs organizer is first and foremost a Bitcoin learner and community builder. You do not need to be a professional developer, but you should have a strong interest in Bitcoin’s technical layer, open-source culture, and community education.

Organizers are expected to demonstrate integrity, curiosity, and consistency.

**Ideal profile of an organizer:**
- Actively involved in local or online Bitcoin technical discussions or open-source communities.
- Reliable and able to plan, coordinate, and follow through on commitments.
- Communicates clearly and respectfully in group settings.
- Understands, or is eager to learn, Bitcoin development concepts.
- Values nuance, neutrality, collaboration, and continuous learning.

## Organizer Roles

Each BitDevs location may structure its organizing team differently, but the following roles are commonly found across strong and sustainable communities.

> **Note:** Some roles may be handled by the same person. Where necessary, it is advised to limit individuals to no more than two roles to avoid burnout.

| Role | Key Responsibilities |
|-----|----------------------|
| **Lead Organizer (required)** | Oversees overall location operations, represents the group in communications with sponsors or partners, and ensures consistency in meetups, documentation, and reporting |
| **Co-organizer(s)** | Supports event planning, topic selection, community engagement, and documentation. May lead sessions or manage logistics |
| **Technical Lead (required)** | Curates and reviews technical discussion topics, ensures content quality, and may moderate Socratic seminars |
| **Finance or Admin Lead (required)** | Manages budgeting, expense tracking, reimbursements, and financial reporting |
| **Volunteer Support** | Assists with event-day logistics such as venue setup, check-ins, photography (with consent), or coordination |

**Core responsibilities include:**
- Hosting consistent, high-quality meetups.
