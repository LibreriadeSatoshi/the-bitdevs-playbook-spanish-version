# Best Practices for Building Strong Teams

Building a strong organizing team is essential for sustainability, consistency, and long-term impact. These best practices help BitDevs locations operate smoothly while avoiding burnout and dependency on a single individual. 

## Start Small

A BitDevs location does not need a large team to start. What matters most is shared commitment and reliability. Begin with 2–3 dependable individuals who can balance technical and organizational strengths. Expand the team gradually as the community grows and needs become clearer.

## Be Clear and Collaborative

Set up clear communication channels and role expectations early. Best practices include:
- Defining roles and responsibilities clearly.
- Using shared folders, checklists, and simple workflows to track tasks.
- Holding short post-event debriefs to review what worked well and what can be improved.

## Encourage Leadership Rotation

Healthy BitDevs locations avoid burnout by distributing responsibilities and rotating leadership where possible. Encourage co-organizers or volunteers to:
- Moderate Socratic discussions.
- Manage event logistics.
- Lead planning for specific meetups.

This builds internal capacity, resilience, and long-term continuity.

## Build a Supportive Culture

Strong teams thrive on trust, communication, and appreciation. Ways to foster a supportive culture include:
- Acknowledging individual contributions openly.
- Celebrating milestones such as successful meetups or consistent attendance.
- Creating space for feedback and honest conversation.

## Support for Btrust-Sponsored Locations

For Btrust-sponsored locations, organizers can request mentorship or peer support through the monthly Organizer Check-ins, where locations across the continent share lessons learned, challenges, and best practices.
