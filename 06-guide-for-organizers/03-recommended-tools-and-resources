# Recommended Tools and Resources

The right tools and resources help organizers run efficient meetups, stay organized, and maintain consistent communication and reporting standards.

## Event and Communication Tools

Recommended tools include:
- [Clooza](https://clooza.com/), [Luma](https://lu.ma/), or [Evento](https://evento.so/) for event registration and attendance tracking.
- Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, or Discord for internal coordination and community engagement.
- Nostr and X (formerly Twitter) for announcements, event recaps, and public communication.
- GitHub or Google Drive for file sharing, reports, and documentation.

Locations may choose tools that best suit their local context, provided records remain accessible and well-maintained.

## Planning and Reporting Templates

Organizers can adapt or create the following templates:
- Meetup Report Template – Summarizes event goals, turnout, discussion topics, and key highlights.
- Finance Report Template – Details all expenses, receipts, and balances.
- Annual Summary Template – Supports long-term review of location growth, activity, and impact.

For Btrust-sponsored locations, all required templates are pre-provided through the shared folder system and must be used consistently.
