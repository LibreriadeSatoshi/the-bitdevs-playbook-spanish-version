# How Sponsorship Works with Btrust

Sponsors play an important role in helping local developer communities thrive by removing logistical barriers and encouraging open technical exchange. This section helps sponsors understand how to meaningfully support BitDevs locations: balancing financial assistance with community independence, and ensuring that sponsorship enhances, rather than shapes, the learning experience.

## The Role of Sponsorship

BitDevs locations are volunteer-led, grassroots initiatives that depend on community commitment and modest funding support. Sponsorships allow organizers to host regular meetups without financial strain, while keeping all events free and open to the public. 

The most effective sponsorships are:

- Simple – Cover essential operational costs only.
- Transparent – Clearly communicated terms and expectations.
- Purpose-driven – Support learning and technical development, not marketing or influence.

## Sponsorship Models

While each sponsor may have a unique approach, support typically takes one of the following forms:

- **Recurring Sponsorship:** Regular funding (monthly or quarterly) for consistent operations.
- **Per-Event Sponsorship:** Funding tied to specific events, conferences, or workshops.
- **In-Kind Support:** Provision of venues, technical resources, printing, or refreshments instead of direct funding.

> Sponsorships must always be **non-conditional**: no promotional requirements, sales pitches, or branding impositions are allowed within BitDevs events.

## Example: Getting Approved for Sponsorship with Btrust

Btrust supports several BitDevs locations across Africa to strengthen local Bitcoin development communities. Sponsorship approval follows a structured process to ensure readiness, transparency, and accountability.

**Steps for Approval (Btrust Example):**

1. **Application:** Submit a brief proposal detailing the city, organizer team, and community interest.
2. **Initial Review:** Btrust evaluates readiness using the BitDevs Starter Checklist, focusing on team structure, developer participation, and sustainability.
3. **Trial Period:** Approved locations begin with a 3-month trial sponsorship starting from their first event. During this phase, organizers must meet reporting and quality standards.
4. **Evaluation and Continuation:** After the trial, Btrust reviews reports and engagement to determine eligibility for ongoing support.

Btrust’s sponsorship is logistics-focused, not influence-based, covering essential costs while preserving the organizer’s full independence over content and format.
