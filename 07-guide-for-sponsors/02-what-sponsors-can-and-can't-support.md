# What Sponsors Can (and Can’t) Support

Sponsors play a key role in supporting operational needs, but their contributions must respect BitDevs’ Bitcoin-only, non-commercial identity. This section clarifies eligible support and off-limits activities.

## Eligible Support Areas

> **Note**: These expenses must always align with BitDevs’ non-commercial, Bitcoin-only identity. 

Sponsors can fund or provide in-kind support for legitimate operational needs that help maintain consistent, high-quality events. Examples include:

- Venue rental or space setup costs.
- Refreshments or light catering for attendees.
- Audio-visual (AV) or internet support for meetups.
- Design and printing of neutral event materials (signage, posters, etc.).
- Technical workshops or travel costs for volunteer speakers, if relevant.

## Note on Coverage

Sponsorship support may not cover 100% of all event costs. Depending on the sponsor’s priorities, budget, and alignment with the location’s goals, funding or in-kind support might cover part or all of the required expenses. Organizers should plan accordingly, and sponsors should feel empowered to contribute in ways that make sense for their resources and mission. The goal is to support sustainability and consistency without creating undue pressure or expectations. 

## Ineligible or Off-Limits Activities

> **Note**: For Btrust-sponsored locations, the approved budget template outlines eligible expense categories and limits. Organizers must keep receipts and submit reports after each event.

BitDevs locations must not accept or use sponsorship funds for activities that compromise neutrality or community trust. These include:

- Paid entry fees or exclusive attendance.
- Altcoin promotion, crypto gambling, marketing campaigns, or token giveaways.
- Paid speaking slots or sponsored presentations.
- Branding outside of the organizer’s own that dominates the event (e.g., banners, sales booths).
- Payments to organizers or attendees.
