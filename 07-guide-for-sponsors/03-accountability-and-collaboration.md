# Accountability and Collaboration 

Maintaining a healthy sponsor-organizer relationship depends on transparency, clear communication, and mutual accountability.

## Transparency in Funding

> **Note**: Sponsors should expect and encourage lean spending: the focus is on consistency, not extravagance. 

Transparency maintains community credibility and sponsor trust. All sponsorship funds should be documented and reported clearly.

**Key accountability practices:**

- Maintain a Finance Report Folder with all receipts and transaction details.
- Submit Meetup Reports summarizing attendance, discussions, and feedback.
- Keep communication open between organizers and sponsors regarding any adjustments.


## Regular Communication

> **Note**: For Btrust-sponsored locations, monthly organizer check-ins serve as a collaborative platform for progress review, support, and troubleshooting.

Strong collaboration relies on regular updates, shared lessons, and honest feedback.

- Organizers should send short recaps after each event focused on impact rather than photo collages.
- Sponsors can provide optional feedback or share insights from other locations.
- Periodic check-ins help both sides align on goals and address challenges early.

## Mutual Accountability

> **Note**: Both parties are encouraged to document expectations at the start of sponsorship and revisit them annually, or at some other mutually agreed frequency.

Accountability is two-sided:

- Organizers must uphold transparency and community standards.
- Sponsors must respect location autonomy and uphold neutrality.
