# Partnering for Long-Term Impact

## The Role of Sustainable Sponsorship

Short-term funding can help locations start, but long-term partnerships help them thrive. The most impactful sponsors focus on continuity, ensuring locations have stability to grow organically. 

**Effective long-term sponsors:**

- Prioritize consistency over scale.
- Encourage cross-community learning rather than central control.
- Invest in capacity-building (e.g., facilitator training, educational materials).

## Building a Network of Shared Purpose

> **Note**: For Btrust, this vision translates into building a network of autonomous, technically grounded communities across the Global South, united by open knowledge and shared values, not brand influence. 

Sponsorship is most effective when aligned with a shared mission: to strengthen open-source Bitcoin development and empower local talent. Sponsors can enhance this mission by:

- Supporting regional collaboration and shared events.
- Providing mentorship and learning resources for organizers.
- Helping locations connect with the wider developer ecosystem. 

## Responsible Exit and Continuity

When a sponsorship term ends, sponsors should ensure a smooth transition:

- Notify organizers in advance of any funding changes.
- Share recommendations for alternative support sources.
- Help preserve continuity by transferring knowledge, contacts, or tools.

> **Note**: This ensures the location remains active and respected even after funding shifts.

Sponsors play a key enabling role in the growth and sustainability of BitDevs locations, not by directing them, but by empowering independence, accountability, and shared learning. Clear communication, transparency, and respect for community autonomy make sponsorship a partnership that drives lasting impact.
