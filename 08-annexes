# Annexes

This section compiles all supplementary materials referenced throughout the Playbook. Each annex provides templates, examples, or checklists to help organizers and sponsors implement the guidance outlined in earlier sections. These documents can be adapted locally, as long as they remain aligned with the Playbook’s principles.

All annexes are living resources. Updates and contributions are welcome as locations grow and new best practices emerge.
