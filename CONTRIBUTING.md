# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the BitDevs Playbook by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/). This Playbook is a living document, and it improves through shared experience from organizers, sponsors, and community members across the ecosystem.

## Who Can Contribute
- BitDevs organizers and volunteers
- Sponsors and partners
- Community members with relevant experience
- Contributors aligned with Bitcoin-only, open-source values

## What You Can Contribute
- Clarifications or improvements to existing sections
- Corrections (typos, broken links, formatting)
- New examples, templates, or best practices
- Feedback or lessons based on real-world organizing experience

## How to Contribute
You can contribute in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/btrustteam/the-bitdevs-playbook/issues)
Use an issue if you want to suggest an improvement / new section, report a problem, or start a discussion. Before opening a new issue, please check [existing issues](https://github.com/btrustteam/the-bitdevs-playbook/issues) to avoid duplicates. If a similar issue exists, feel free to add a comment or 👍 to help us prioritize the most common problems and requests.

A good issue includes:
- The relevant section or file name
- A clear description of the issue or suggestion
- Why the change would improve the Playbook

### Option 2: Submit a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/btrustteam/the-bitdevs-playbook/pulls)
Use a pull request if you are ready to propose a concrete change.

Steps:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch from master
3. Make your edits with clear, descriptive commit messages
4. Open a pull request describing:
   - What changed
   - Why it improves the Playbook

Small pull requests (typos, formatting, clarifications) are always welcome. For larger changes, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss the idea and ensure alignment before doing extensive work.

## Contribution Principles
All contributions must:
- Remain Bitcoin-only
- Be non-commercial and neutral
- Respect community autonomy
- Align with BitDevs principles and ethos

Please write clearly, simply, and with organizers in mind. The goal is to make the Playbook practical, accessible, and easy to apply across different regions.

## Review Process
All submissions are reviewed by the Playbook maintainer and, when necessary, relevant organizers or contributors. Feedback may be provided before a contribution is merged.

Thank you for helping strengthen the BitDevs ecosystem.
