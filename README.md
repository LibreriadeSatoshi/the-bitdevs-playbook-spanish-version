The BitDevs Playbook by [Btrust](https://www.btrust.tech/) is a comprehensive guide for organizers, sponsors, and partners involved in growing Bitcoin-only technical communities across the Global South, starting with Africa. It provides a framework for starting, operating, and sustaining BitDevs locations with consistent quality, transparency, and impact. 

The playbook serves as:  
- A manual for organizers setting up or managing BitDevs locations.  
- A reference for sponsors and partners to understand processes, reporting, and accountability standards.  
- A resource for participants and community members to align with the broader BitDevs movement.


## How to Use This Playbook
The playbook mirrors the lifecycle of a BitDevs location: setup, operations, quality control, and closure (if necessary). Each section includes steps, templates, and references. While reading the full playbook is recommended to understand how BitDevs locations operate as a cohesive network, the guidance below helps you get started based on your role.

- **New Organizers:** Start with Section 2: [“Starting a BitDevs Location”](02-starting-a-bitdevs-location/01-setting-up-a-location.md) to learn how to set up a new location from scratch. Follow with Section 4: [“Quality Control”](04-quality-control/01-core-standards.md) for standards from day one. Then, read Section 6: [“Guide for Organizers”](06-guide-for-organizers/01-roles-and-responsibilities.md) for team and personal development guidance.
- **Active Locations:** Focus first on Section 3: [“Running a BitDevs Location”](03-running-a-bitdevs-location/01-meetup-planning-and-coordination.md) for operational guidance. Revisit Section 4: [“Quality Control”](04-quality-control/01-core-standards.md) regularly. Refer to Section 6: [“Guide for Organizers”](06-guide-for-organizers/01-roles-and-responsibilities.md) to continue developing your team and skills.
- **Sponsors and Supporters:** Refer to Section 7 ([“Guide for Sponsors”](07-guide-for-sponsors/01-how-sponsorship-works-with-btrust.md)) for funding models, accountability, and collaboration expectations.   
- **Everyone:** Begin with Section 1: [“Introduction”](01-introduction/01-about-this-playbook.md) for foundational BitDevs principles, identity, and ethos.
- **Annexes:** Contain templates, examples, and checklists referenced throughout the playbook for practical use.
