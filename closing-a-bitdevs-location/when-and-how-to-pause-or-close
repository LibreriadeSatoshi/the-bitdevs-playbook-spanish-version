# Closing a BitDevs Location

Even the most active and well-run locations may eventually reach a point where operations need to pause, transition, or close entirely. Closing a location is not a failure; it is part of the natural lifecycle of community building. When done responsibly, it preserves credibility, protects resources, and keeps the door open for future revival.

This section outlines how to identify when closure is appropriate, the process for managing it transparently, and the steps for possible reactivation later.

# When and How to Pause or Close a Location

A BitDevs location may need to pause or close for various valid reasons. The key is to do so intentionally and responsibly, with clear communication to your community and any supporting partners.

## Common Reasons for Pause or Closure

- **Inactivity or Low Engagement**  
  A sustained decline in attendance or participation over several months. What counts as “low” will vary by location; organizers should compare against their usual turnout. For example, if attendance drops noticeably below typical numbers for three consecutive months, it may indicate low engagement.

- **Leadership or Team Transition**  
  Departure of core organizers without successors ready to continue operations.

- **Resource or Funding Limitations**  
  Challenges maintaining consistent venues, logistics, or financial support.

- **Strategic Pause**  
  A temporary suspension to restructure, onboard new organizers, or reset the direction of the community.

## Pause or Closure Process (General)

- **Internal Discussion**  
  The organizing team should meet to review challenges, confirm the decision, and explore alternatives such as recruiting new volunteers or merging with a nearby BitDevs location.

- **Community Notification**  
  Inform your members through your regular communication channels (website, Telegram, Nostr, or X). Be transparent: acknowledge contributions, briefly share reasons, and express openness to future revival.

- **Documentation and Handover**  
  Compile all materials, including meetup summaries, attendance data, photos, and reports, into the shared location folder to preserve institutional memory.

- **Responsible Wind-down**  
  Cancel any upcoming events, close pending sponsorship requests, and formally conclude engagements with venues, partners, or collaborators.

## For Btrust-Sponsored Locations

If your location is under Btrust sponsorship, you must notify the Btrust team at least one month in advance before pausing or closing. This ensures proper documentation, support, and closure of all financial and reporting processes.

### Steps to Notify and Close (Btrust Process)

- **Written Notification**  
  Submit a short statement explaining the decision, reasons, and expected date of pause or closure.

- **Exit Call (Optional)**  
  A brief discussion with the Btrust team may be scheduled to review lessons learned and explore possible transitions or future reopening.

- **Closure Checklist**  
  Complete all final reports, reconcile expenses, and confirm that documentation is accurate and up to date.

- **Official Confirmation**  
  Once reviewed, Btrust will mark the location as *paused* or *inactive*, keeping it listed for potential future reactivation.
